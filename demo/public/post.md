I always strive to go the extra mile and deliver beyond expectations. The following sections will recap everything I‚Äôve produced so far:\n\n### Libraries\n\n- **Front-end utilities library:** [reactivedot.dev](https://reactivedot.dev/)\n- **Wallets connector library:** [dotconnect.dev](https://dotconnect.dev/)\n- **Forum posts:**\n - [Reactive DOT - A reactive library for building Substrate front-ends](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/reactive-dot-a-reactive-library-for-building-substrate-front-ends/8655/17)\n - [Show and tell | ReactiveDOT √ó PAPI](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/show-and-tell-reactivedot-x-papi/9388)\n\n### Applications\n\nIn addition to building libraries, I've also taken the initiative to create a developer console during my free time, aptly named "DOTConsole". This application serves three main purposes:\n\n1. A means to test and experiment with my libraries.\n2. A reference application showcasing the ease of building with next-gen libraries.\n3. Following positive feedback, it may also serve as a potential devtool replacement for the aging PJS App, without the downside of being geared toward everyday users.\n\nYou can check out the full details in this [forum post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/show-and-tell-reactivedot-x-papi/9388). But here‚Äôs a quick sneak peek:\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1AYzbysR.png)\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkl6zZ1oA.png)\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1Nu7WkoR.png)\n\n### Other activities within the ecosystem\n\n- Being independently funded by the treasury has allowed me to contribute to various other projects within the Polkadot ecosystem. You can view these contributions on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/tien).\n- I've also submitted my [application](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/collective/pull/25) to join the Polkadot Tooling Collective (PoToC) to further cement my part as a long-term contributor.\n\n## Q&A\n\n**Q: Why did the previous proposals request DOT?**\n\n**A:** When [#812](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/812) was being prepared, requesting in stablecoins wasn't generally available and still wasn't well established by the time [#948](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/948) was created. My very first proposal ([#811](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/811)) was incorrectly formatted due to a front-end bug, which I was told occurred because of ongoing upgrades to support stablecoins. This experience made me hesitant to try something not well documented. To play it safe, I requested in DOT. All future proposals, if any, will be requested in stable amounts instead.\n\n**Q: Why didn't you request top-up for [#812](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/812) right after it was awarded?**\n\n**A:** I'm still relatively new to OpenGov, having only been involved for roughly three months as of this writing. Requesting additional funds immediately after the passing of my first proposal, without strong deliverables proving my ethic, would be in bad taste in my opinion.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For any further questions please leave your comment below!\n\n## Closing remark\n\nI hope that these deliverables, along with the many extra works I've been taking on, clearly demonstrate my strong commitment to Polkadot and my consistent effort to **always** go above and beyond. Therefore, reassures you of the investment Polkadot OpenGov is putting in me (including this top-up), as well as my personal long-term investment to improve the Polkadot ecosystem. üôè\n
